Bliss was my entry for [Ludum Dare 26](http://ludumdare.com/compo) this time with the theme [Minimalism](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview).

## [Play Bliss](game/)

While the goal of Ludum Dare is to make a _game_ in 48 hours my entry was not much more than a technical demo. It was one of my first time working with the wonderful [three.js](http://threejs.org/) and also one of the first times working with 3D programming in general. It was also an experiment to see if I could make some semirealistic water physics. 

The game itself is very lackluster. You can sail a little boat over the sea (and the land) but there is nothing else to do. Looking at the comments it seems that people really liked the looks (ending on spot 200 of 1608 in the category _graphics_) but many wanted some goal or anything that makes a game a game.
