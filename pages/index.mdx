## 🎨 [Tapart](https://www.tapart.me)

> Building apps, websites, audio- and multimediatours, experiences and other cool stuff for museums and the cultural sector.

At Tapart we are building a platform for museums and the cultural sector to easily create engaging multimediatours for their customers. We are using React Native to simultaneously target Android, iOS and dedicated hardware.

As we are startup with a small but dedicated team I took on most of the technical responsibilty. While my expertise is in front-end developing I found myself working on every layer of our stack regularly.

Amongst Taparts clients are [🌻 Van Gogh Museum](https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/), [Museum M](https://www.mleuven.be/) in Leuven, [Museum Boijmans van Beuningen](https://www.boijmans.nl/en) in Rotterdam and [Groninger Museum](http://www.groningermuseum.nl/).
